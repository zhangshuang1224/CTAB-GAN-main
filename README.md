The required package version
```
numpy==1.21.0
torch==1.9.1
pandas==1.2.4
sklearn==0.24.1
dython==0.6.4.post1
scipy==1.4.1
```
The sklean package in newer version has updated its function for `sklearn.mixture.BayesianGaussianMixture`. Therefore, user should use this proposed sklearn version to successfully run the code!

## Example
`Experiment_Script_Adult.ipynb` is an example notebook for training CTAB-GAN with Adult dataset. The dataset is alread under `Real_Datasets` folder.
The evaluation code is also provided.

## For large dataset

If your dataset has large number of column, you may encounter the problem that our currnet code cannot encode all of your data since CTAB-GAN will wrap the encoded data into an image-like format. What you can do is changing the line 341 and 348 in `model/synthesizer/ctabgan_synthesizer.py`. The number in the `slide` list
```
sides = [4, 8, 16, 24, 32]
```
is the side size of image. You can enlarge the list to [4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64] or [4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 128] for accepting larger dataset.
